github course
short and sweet

git provides
version control systems
collaboration
cloud backup

repository is a place where you store code
as per best practice, each software project should have its own repo.

lets create a new repo for bash
https://github.com/maviharjit/bash

stackoverflow is a good resource for programers
using stackoverflow is an essential part of being a programmer

mkdir mylocal-software-folder && cd $_
git init

.git folder implies that you have already setup git in that particular folder

you may want to create the following files per project.

README.md
echo "# bash" >> README.md

.gitignore
files that you dont want to upload to github. e.g xcode specific exclude files
.DS_Store
.*xcurserstate
project.xcworkspace/
xcurserdata/

you will always have a local repo and an online repo
always keep track of which one you are working off

# add local files to git repo
git add --all
git status
git commit -m "initial commit"

# tell you local git repo about the github repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/maviharjit/bash

# committing to github 
git push -u origin master
above is saying "push the code from my local repo i.e. master to remote i.e. origin
git status


# after you modify a file lets say README.md
git status
git add README.md
git commit -m "Updated README.md"
git push -u origin master
