rackspace and NASA started the openstack intitiative
openstack is easily installed using "packstack"

packstack uses puppet to automatically provision openstack
for proof of concept you can install openstack in a hypervisor

openstack has various components providing various services.
Compute (Nova)
Networking (Neutron)
Block Storage (Cinder)
Identity (Keystone)
Image (Glance)
Object Storage (Swift)
Dashboard (Horizon)
Orchestration (Heat)

# to try openstack in the cloud

# install on your system
# hardware requirements
open stack needs at least three nodes
controller node, network node, compute node
there are more optional node
block storage node 1, object storage node 1, object storage node 2

conroller node
CPU: 1-2
RAM: 8G
Storage: 100G
NIC: 1

network node
CPU: 1-2
RAM: 2G
Storage: 50G
NIC: 3

compute node
CPU: 2-4+
RAM: 8G+
Storage: 100G+
NIC: 2

# hardware requirement for a Proof of Concept installation with core services and few cirrOS VM instances
conroller node
CPU: 1
RAM: 2G
Storage: 5G
NIC: 1

network node
CPU: 1
RAM: 512Mb
Storage: 5G
NIC: 3

compute node
CPU: 2
RAM: 2G
Storage: 10G
NIC: 2

we use a minimal installation of 64 bit linux for this environment on a VM

# installation
since centos is so close to redhat, lets do it on centos 7.2 VM
install packstack. available on authors github
https://github.com/espiderinc/tutorial-openstack/blob/master/Packstack%20installation.txt



make sure following three services  are running once openstack installation finishes
systemctl | egrep "rabbitmq-server|httpd|mariadb"
# if they are not "loaded active running" then restart like following
systemctl restart rabbitmq-server.service
