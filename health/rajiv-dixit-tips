dont drink water just after food
drink after one hour

stomach is amal i.e acidic
spit is char i.e. alkaline
so drink water sip by sip
dont do bottoms up
this is how rest of the animals do
it is best for you if ph value of stomach stays near zero. 

dont drink cold water. ever.

drink water first thing after you wake up.
it cleans your intestine 
clean stomach means no disease.
